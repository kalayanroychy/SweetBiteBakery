# SweetBite Bakery Application

## Overview

SweetBite Bakery is a full-stack e-commerce application for a bakery business. The application follows a modern web architecture with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend, using Drizzle ORM for database operations. The application allows customers to browse products, add items to a cart, and place orders, while providing an admin interface for managing products, categories, and orders.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes

- **Cart Calculation Fix (June 18, 2025)**: Resolved cart calculation errors by updating product prices from USD to proper BDT amounts in database and clearing corrupted localStorage cache data
- **React Warning Fix (June 18, 2025)**: Fixed React setState warning in CartProvider by moving localStorage operations to useEffect hook instead of during component initialization

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: React-based SPA built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS using the shadcn/ui component library
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework, serving both the API and static assets
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM)
4. **Authentication**: Session-based authentication for admin users

The frontend and backend are tightly coupled in a monorepo structure, with shared types and schemas defined in a common directory.

### Development Architecture

During development, the application uses:
- Vite's development server with HMR for the frontend
- Express middleware mode to handle API requests
- In-memory storage as a fallback when database connection isn't available

### Production Architecture

In production:
- Frontend is built as static assets using Vite
- Backend serves these static assets and API endpoints
- Database persistence through PostgreSQL

## Key Components

### Backend Components

1. **Express Server** (`server/index.ts`):
   - Main server entry point
   - Configures middleware and routes
   - Logs API requests with relevant information

2. **Routes** (`server/routes.ts`):
   - Defines API endpoints for products, categories, orders, and authentication
   - Implements RESTful conventions
   - Loads initial data if the database is empty

3. **Storage** (`server/storage.ts`):
   - Provides a unified interface for data operations
   - Implements CRUD operations for products, categories, users, and orders
   - Includes an in-memory implementation for development

4. **Authentication** (`server/auth.ts`):
   - Manages user authentication and authorization
   - Implements middleware for protected routes
   - Handles password hashing and verification

5. **Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`):
   - Defines database schema using Drizzle ORM
   - Implements Zod validation schemas for input data
   - Exports TypeScript types for application-wide use

### Frontend Components

1. **Application Shell** (`client/src/App.tsx`):
   - Sets up routing with Wouter
   - Configures global providers for theming, queries, and cart state

2. **Pages**:
   - `Home.tsx`: Landing page with featured products and categories
   - `Products.tsx`: Product catalog with filtering capabilities
   - `ProductDetails.tsx`: Detailed view of individual products
   - `Cart.tsx`: Shopping cart management
   - `Checkout.tsx`: Order placement and payment processing
   - Admin pages for dashboard, product management, and authentication

3. **Components**:
   - UI components from shadcn/ui library
   - Custom components for layout, product listings, and checkout process
   - Reusable UI elements following a consistent design language

4. **Hooks**:
   - `use-cart.tsx`: Cart state management with localStorage persistence
   - `use-query-state.tsx`: URL query parameter management
   - `use-toast.ts`: Toast notification system
   - `use-mobile.tsx`: Responsive design utility

## Data Flow

1. **Product Browsing Flow**:
   - User accesses the application
   - Frontend loads categories and featured products from the API
   - User browses products by category or search
   - Product details are loaded on demand

2. **Cart Management Flow**:
   - User adds products to cart
   - Cart state is managed in the browser and persisted in localStorage
   - User can adjust quantities or remove items
   - Cart totals are calculated on the client

3. **Checkout Flow**:
   - User fills out shipping and payment information
   - Order is submitted to the API
   - Confirmation is displayed to the user
   - Order is stored in the database

4. **Admin Flow**:
   - Admin logs in with credentials
   - Session is established on the server
   - Admin can view dashboard statistics
   - Admin can manage products and categories

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React**: Core UI library
- **Wouter**: Lightweight routing library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library based on Radix UI

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following features:

1. **Build Process**:
   - Frontend: Vite builds static assets
   - Backend: esbuild bundles the server code
   - Combined into a single deployable package

2. **Runtime Configuration**:
   - Environment variables for database connection
   - Production mode optimizations

3. **Database Provisioning**:
   - PostgreSQL database via Replit's built-in database service
   - Schema migrations with Drizzle Kit

4. **Scaling**:
   - Configured for auto-scaling deployment

5. **Development Experience**:
   - Hot Module Replacement for frontend
   - Automatic restart for backend changes
   - Error overlay for runtime errors
